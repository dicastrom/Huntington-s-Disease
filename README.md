# Huntington-s-Disease
Python Program that can either read in a text file with "C" "A" "G" "T" characters from a genome and determine if said genome belongs to a person with Huntington's Disease or randomly generate and evaluate a genome. I used a 6-state DFA (Definite Finite Automata) to determine if someone is at a high-risk of suffering from Huntington's Disease.
